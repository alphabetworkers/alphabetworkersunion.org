## Pay parity for all TVCs

We believe that all workers at Google should receive the full wages they are legally entitled to and have earned. We demand that Google immediately pay back all Temps, Vendors and Contractors (TVCs) who have been knowingly underpaid by Google. 

It has recently come to light, as reported by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/technology/google-temporary-workers-labor-laws-pay.html) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/10/google-underpaid-workers-illegal-pay-disparity-documents), that Google has knowingly underpaid TVCs across dozens of countries, in direct violation of pay parity laws across the globe. [Google has consistently obscured its employees’ salaries](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/31/18644866/google-contractors-pay-ratings-glassdoor)—and now, we know more about why. 

Join our fight to dismantle the two-tiered perma-temp system. Sign and share our [letter for TVC workers](https://payparity.org/)!

## Changing Alphabet

Before publicly announcing the Alphabet Workers Union on January 4th, 2021, our union has been involved in affecting change at Alphabet. We will continue to take action when there are injustices in the workplace and when we believe Alphabet isn’t living up to our [values]({{< ref "principles/mission-statement" >}}).

We will continue to share our efforts here and defend our fellow workers! When we organize, we win! To learn about our successful campaigns, check out [our wins]({{< ref "power/wins" >}}).
