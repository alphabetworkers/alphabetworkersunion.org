When we organize, we win!

## Drop the deadnames

As a transgender man, Phares Lee had to live with his deadname on his name badge while working at Google for the past three years. He asked repeatedly for this to change
through all the proper channels. It never changed, and his deadname remained on his badge until he took collective action with AWU-CWA. He has now been issued a new name
badge with his chosen name on it, and been told that he can participate in ERGs just like a full-time employee can. His individual issues are now being fixed, which sets a
precedent for others with similar issues. But, our work together isn’t done. We need to ensure that what happened to Phares never again happens to any other worker.

## Be bold interns

We helped Google BOLD interns convince the company to give them a $5,000 stipend for housing and other needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read about

## Data center workers: know our rights

On January 27th, 2021, Shannon Wait made the following Facebook post:

"My employer told us who do heavy lifting and manual labor that if we lose our bottle of water or cap that they will not be replacing it DURING A PANDEMIC but you can't take extra breaks to go get water so just stay thirsty and be glad you have a job."

Earlier during the pandemic, [she and other data center workers were promised bonus pay](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56659212),
but when she asked about that bonus, she was told by a manager via email that
"It is never ok to discuss compensation with your peers".

Watch Shannon share her story:

After asking members of Alphabet Workers Union to help her file an unfair labor practice against Google and
Modis, a settlement was reached, which includes Shannon's suspension being overturned and Google posting a document in her data
center that states, "You have the right to discuss wage rates, bonuses, and working conditions".

Shannon knew her rights. If you're a data center worker and want to learn more about your rights as a worker, [let us know](https://airtable.com/shr3RpVTuP25kHMdm)!
